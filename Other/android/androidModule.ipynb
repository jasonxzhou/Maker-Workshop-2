    "## App Fundamentals\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll talk about some of the basic ideas behind Android apps. For even more details, check out [this page](https://developer.android.com/guide/components/fundamentals.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "We use Java to write Android apps, and the Android SDK tools will put all your code, data, and resource files into an APK (i.e. an Android package). An APK contains everything an Android app needs to run, which is then used by Android devices to install the app.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### App Components\n",
    "\n",
    "Android apps essentially boil down to four components:\n",
    "1. Activities\n",
    "2. Services\n",
    "3. Content providers\n",
    "4. Broadcast receivers\n",
    "    \n",
    "The first component is the one you will need to know most immediately. The others, while important, may be more complicated than you really need to understand to write an app if you're just starting out. This is simply a boiled down reference in case it helps or is interesting!\n",
    "    \n",
    "#### Activities\n",
    "* One activity represents *one* screen with a UI.\n",
    "* Each activity is independent of the others, even if they work together. For example, this lets a camera app open up the \"write a new message\" activity in a messaging app, instead of the entire messaging app.\n",
    "* Activities keep track of what's on-screen so the system will run the processes needed to host them and help handle those processes. They also allow different apps to flow between each other more smoothly.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Services\n",
    "* Services run in the background to do operations that happen over a considerable period of time or to do work for remote processes.\n",
    "* Services do not have a UI; the user is usually not even directly aware that they are running.\n",
    "* Services allow you to listen to music in the background or quietly sync data.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Content Providers\n",
    "* Content providers handle a shared set of app data. This data can be stored in the file system, in a database, online, or any other form of persistent storage that your app can access.\n",
    "* Content providers determine if other apps can access or change this data.\n",
    "* They can also read/write data that is specific to your app.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Broadcast Receivers\n",
    "* Broadcast receivers receive events from the system, enabling the app to respond to system-wide broadcast announcements.\n",
    "* An example would be, an app can schedule a notification to give the user a reminder. That app's BroadcastReceiver will get this alarm, and thus the app doesn't need to be continually running.\n",
    "* The system most often sends out broadcasts, but apps can initiate them too.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### Android Manifest\n",
    "\n",
    "Another important fundamental is the Android manifest file, i.e `AndroidManifest.xml`, which must be located in the root project directory. This file does many things, including:\n",
    "* Declaring what the app's components are (`<activity>`, `<service>`, `<provider>`, `<receiver>`)\n",
    "* Identifying user permissions required by the app\n",
    "* Declaring the app's minimum required API level\n",
    "* Declaring what hardware/software features the app uses or requires\n",
    "* Declaring what API libraries the app needs to be linked up with\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### App Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "Your app will typically involve more than just code. You may need resources that range anywhere from images, to audio, to animations, to styles, colors, to UI layouts, and much more. Plus, you may need to provide different sets of resources in order to optimize for different device configs, e.g. languages or screen sizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Any resource you include will get a unique integer ID, autogenerated by the SDK build tools. It will then get a unique name, also autogenerated, that you can use to reference said resource in your code. For example, if you save an image file called `coolPic.png` in the `res/drawable/` folder, the SDK tools will generate an ID for it: `R.drawable.coolPic`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",

    "## Creating a User Interface\n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we'll talk about how to create a simple layout.\n",
    "\n",
    "Android app GUIs are constructed from `View` and `ViewGroup` objects. A `View` is typically a UI element like a text field or an image. A `ViewGroup` is simply an invisible container that defines the layout of the views it contains, e.g. in a grid. A `Layout` is a type of `ViewGroup` that specifies a particular, well, layout. We will be using what's called a `LinearLayout`.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Let's edit the layout of our main activity. From the **Project** window, open up **app > res > layout > activity_main.xml**.\n",

    "3. Delete the \"Hello World\" text by selecting it and pressing \"Delete\" on your keyboard OR by right-clicking and selecting \"Delete\" from the menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Scroll down the \"Palette\" pane on the left side and select the \"Plain Text\" type of `EditText` view. Click and drag this onto the layout of your app - a dashed box should show you where the view will be placed.\n",

We'll edit the following attributes: `ID` to `enter_message`, `inputType` to `textShortMessage`, `hint` to `Enter a message...`, and `text` to an empty string. If you get a message to \"Update usages as well?\", click \"Yes\". It should look like the following:\n",

    "![Edit the properties of our 'Button' view](androidDiagrams/5activity_main_editedButtonAttributes.PNG)\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Great! Let's make this layout more robust by editing the **res > values > strings.xml** file. Open this file and add lines to it, such that it now looks like this:\n",
    "    ```xml\n",

    "        \n",
    "    </resources>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    Generally speaking, whenever you use text in your UI, specify each string as a resource in strings.xml. This puts UI text in just one place, so you can update it one place instead of updating all text manually, one-by-one. (It also makes localization easier, if you ever want to translate your app.)\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Go back to **activity_main.xml**. Click on the `EditText` and change its `hint` from \"Enter a message...\" to \"@string/enter_message\". Then, click on the `Button` and change its `text` from `Send` to `@string/button_send`. For example, your `button_send` properties should look like this:\n",

    "10. We now have a basic UI! If you'd like to run the app and see how it looks on your emulator, click **Run** in the toolbar - it will look like a square with a green triangle in it.\n",

    "2. You'll be shown the graphical layout design editor, the Layout Editor. Switch to the **Text** tab at the bottom so we can work with the XML directly.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Replace everything in the file with the following:\n",
    "    ```xml\n",
    "    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n",
    "    <LinearLayout\n",
    "            xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n",
    "            xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n",
    "            android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n",
    "            android:layout_height=\"match_parent\"\n",
    "            android:orientation=\"horizontal\">\n",
    "    </LinearLayout>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    As mentioned before, `LinearLayout` is a `ViewGroup`; it lays out child views in the order that they appear in the XML file, either vertically or horizontally, depending on what is specified by the `android:orientation` attribute. Here, we will lay out our views horizontally using this `LinearLayout` as our root view - root meaning fundamental/base.\n",
    "\n",
    "    `android:layout_width` and `android:layout_height` are required attributes that describe how a view will be sized; `match_parent` means that a view will expand its height/width to *match* that of its parent view. Since `LinearLayout` is our root view, we want it to fill the entire screen - hence, we will have it match the height/width of its parent.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Now let's add a text field. Within `<LinearLayout>`, add an `<EditText>` element:\n",
    "\n",
    "    ```xml\n",
    "    <LinearLayout\n",
    "        xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n",

    "        <!-- ^^^ ADD CODE ABOVE ^^^ -->\n",
    "\n",
    "    </LinearLayout>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    * **`android:id`**: This gives our `EditText` view a unique identifier so we can reference this exact object in our Java code. We need the `@` whenever we reference an XML resource, followed by the resource type, a slash, then the name (`edit_message`); the `+` is only needed the first time we define an ID.\n",
    "    * **`android:layout_width`**, **`android:layout_height`**: We give these attributes the `wrap_content` value so that the view is only big enough to fit the view's content. (Using `match_parent` would fill the screen.)\n",
    "    * **`android:hint`**: If the text field is empty, we will display this default string. `@string/enter_message` refers to a string resource found in a separate file, which we will soon define.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Let's define `@string/enter_message` (plus some other strings)! By default, our project is created with a string resource file, **res > values > strings.xml**. Open this file.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Add two new strings. Your file should look like this:\n",
    "    ```xml\n",
    "    <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"utf-8\"?>\n",
    "    <resources>\n",
    "        <string name=\"app_name\">My First App</string>\n",
    "        \n",
    "        <!-- These two strings! -->\n",
    "        <string name=\"enter_message\">Enter a message</string>\n",
    "        <string name=\"button_send\">Send</string>\n",

    "    </resources>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Generally speaking, whenever you use text in your UI, specify each string as a resource in **strings.xml**. This puts UI text in just one place, so you can update it one place instead of updating all text manually, one-by-one. (It also makes localization easier, if you ever want to translate your app.)\n",
    "    \n",
    "7. Let's add a button! Return to **activity_main.xml**. Insert the code after `<EditText>` as follows:\n",
    "    ```xml\n",
    "    <LinearLayout\n",
    "    xmlns:android=\"http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android\"\n",
    "    xmlns:tools=\"http://schemas.android.com/tools\"\n",
    "    android:orientation=\"horizontal\"\n",
    "    android:layout_width=\"match_parent\"\n",
    "    android:layout_height=\"match_parent\">\n",
    "        <EditText android:id=\"@+id/edit_message\"\n",
    "          android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n",
    "          android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n",
    "          android:hint=\"@string/edit_message\" />\n",
    "          \n",
    "        <!-- Your new button! -->\n",
    "        <Button android:id=\"@+id/button_send\"\n",
    "          android:layout_width=\"wrap_content\"\n",
    "          android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n",
    "          android:text=\"@string/button_send\" />\n",
    "        <!-- ^^^ There it is! ^^^ -->\n",
    "        \n",
    "    </LinearLayout>\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "    * Again, `wrap_content` makes it such that both `EditText` and `Button` will only be big enough to fit their content.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. You're finished with your first UI! Switch to `Design` to see what your layout looks like visually; to see it on your emulator, click **Run** in the toolbar - it will look like a square with a green triangle in it.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. **(Optional)** In order to make the layout look a bit nicer, let's get the `EditText` view to fill up the unused screen width. Modify its attributes to look like this:\n",
    "    ```xml\n",
    "    <EditText android:id=\"@+id/edit_message\"\n",
    "        android:layout_weight=\"1\"\n",
    "        android:layout_width=\"0dp\"\n",
    "        android:layout_height=\"wrap_content\"\n",
    "        android:hint=\"@string/edit_message\" />\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "\n",
    "You just added a new attribute called `layout_weight` and changed `layout_width` to `0dp`.  A \"weight\" value basically describes how much space a child view should take up relative to its sibling views. This is kind of like a recipe for a smoothie: \"3 parts strawberry, 1 part banana\" means 3/4 of your smoothie consists of strawberries. So what setting `layout_weight` to `1` does is make the `EditText` view take up as much space as it can in this `LinearLayout`. Meanwhile, we set `layout_width` to `0dp` because otherwise, the system wastes time calculating a width appropriate for `wrap_content`, a value we won't use anyway.\n",

    "    \n",
    "    Now, whenever the \"Send\" button is clicked, the system will call the `sendMessage()` method in our activity thanks to this `onClick` attribute.\n",
    "    \n",
    "2. Next, navigate to **java > com.example.myfirstapp > MainActivity.java**. Add the `sendMessage()` method as follows:\n",

    "        }\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    > *Note #1*: the `onCreate(Bundle)` method simply initializes the activity. It sets the \"content view\" by giving it a layout resource that defines the UI - here, it is **`R.layout.activity_main`**, which is an autogenerated name for our **activity_main.xml** file that we just edited above.\n",

    "    Android Studio will give you **Cannot resolve symbol** errors, but you just need to import some classes - try pressing Alt + Enter (Option + Return on Mac). You will still have an error for `DisplayMessageActivity`, but we'll resolve that soon by creating that class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    So what's happening in this `sendMessage` method?\n",
    "    * The `Intent` takes a `Context` (because `Activity` is a subclass of `Context`) and the `Class` of the component that you should send the `Intent` to - i.e., the activity you want to start.\n",
    "    * `findViewById()` finds the view we called `enter_message` in our **activity_mail.xml**\n",
    "    * `Intent` objects can hold data types as key-value pairs called **extras**. We use the public constant `MY_MESSAGE` as a key so the next activity can use it. In general, it's good practice to use your app's package name as a prefix when defining keys for extras - in case your app interacts with other apps, your keys are thus guaranteed to be unique.\n",
    "    * `startActivity(intent)` does exactly what you'd expect: start a new instance of `DisplayMessageActivity`, based on what the `Intent` specified.\n",
    "    \n",

    "5. On the **Configure Activity** window, enter \"DisplayMessageActivity\" as the **Activity Name**, then click **Finish**. Automatically, Android Studio will do 3 things:\n",
    "    * Create the class `DisplayMessageActivity` with a generic implementation of the required method `onCreate()`\n",
    "    * Create a corresponding layout file called **activity_display_message.xml**\n",
    "    * Add the necessary `<activity>` element in the `AndroidManifest.xml`\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Now, if you run your app and click the \"Send\" button, this new empty activity will start.\n",
    "    \n",
    "6. Let's add some content to our new activity. In `DisplayMessageActivity.java`, add this code to the `onCreate()` method:\n",
    "    ```java\n",
    "    @Override\n",
    "    protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {\n",
    "       super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);\n",
    "       setContentView(R.layout.activity_display_message);\n",
    "        \n",
    "       // gets the intent used to start this activity\n",
    "       Intent intent = getIntent();\n",
    "       \n",
    "       // constructs a new TextView from the intent's extras\n",
    "       String message = intent.getStringExtra(MainActivity.MY_MESSAGE);\n",
    "       TextView textView = new TextView(this);\n",
    "       textView.setTextSize(40);\n",
    "       textView.setText(message);\n",
    "        \n",
    "       // adds the new TextView to DisplayMessageActivity's layout\n",
    "       ViewGroup layout = (ViewGroup) findViewById(R.id.activity_display_message);\n",
    "       layout.addView(textView);\n",
    "    }\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "    \n",
    "    As before, use Alt + Enter (Option + Return on Mac) to import missing classes. Note that you can cast the layout to `ViewGroup`, since it is the supercass of all layouts ([see diagram above](#Creating-a-User-Interface)).\n",
    "    \n",
    "    > If `findViewById()` fails, Android Studio may not have automatically generated the `android:id` attribute. If so, navigate to **activity_display_message.xml** and add `android:id=\"@+id/activity_display_message\"` to the layout element.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Now, if you run the app, type a message in the text field and hit \"Send\". The second activity should pop up, displaying the message you typed in the first activity.\n",
