Reddit actually has a **API** (Application Program Interface) so that developers like us are easily able to access the information posted on Reddit. An API contains numerous prewritten functions/actions that we can directly use without having to write ourselves. If you are interested in exploring the extensive API yourself, check it out [here](https://www.reddit.com/dev/api).\n",

The use of JSON derived from JavaScript, but now is used in many more languages including Python, which we will be using today.\n",
